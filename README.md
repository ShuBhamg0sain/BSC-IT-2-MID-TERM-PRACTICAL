Q1 

<B>Problem statement:</B>
<N><p align=justify>Tieu owns a pizza restaurant and he manages it in his own way. While in a normal restaurant, a customer is served by following the first-come, first-served rule, Tieu simply minimizes the average waiting time of his customers. So he gets to decide who is served first, regardless of how sooner or later a person comes.
Different kinds of pizzas take different amounts of time to cook. Also, once he starts cooking a pizza, he cannot cook another pizza until the first pizza is completely cooked. Let's say we have three customers who come at time t=0, t=1, & t=2 respectively, and the time needed to cook their pizzas is 3, 9, & 6 respectively. If Tieu applies first-come, first-served rule, then the waiting time of three customers is 3, 11, & 16 respectively. The average waiting time in this case is (3 + 11 + 16) / 3 = 10. This is not an optimized solution. After serving the first customer at time t=3, Tieu can choose to serve the third customer. In that case, the waiting time will be 3, 7, & 17 respectively. Hence the average waiting time is (3 + 7 + 17) / 3 = 9.
Help Tieu achieve the minimum average waiting time. For the sake of simplicity, just find the integer part of the minimum average waiting time.</N></p>

<B>Input Format:</B>

The first line contains an integer N, which is the number of customers.

In the next N lines, the ith line contains two space separated numbers Ti and Li. Ti is the time when ith customer order a pizza, and Li is the time required to cook that pizza.

The  customer is not the customer arriving at the  arrival time.

<B>Output Format:</B>

Display the integer part of the minimum average waiting time.

<B>Note:</B>

The waiting time is calculated as the difference between the time a customer orders pizza (the time at which they enter the shop) and the time she is served.

Cook does not know about the future orders.

the integer part is 8 and hence the answer.

<B><p align=justify>Q2:  Each process p1 p2 p3 p4    with arrival  time and cpu time respectively(0,10)(0,2)(0,1)(04). Write a c program to implement SJF algorithm and find out turn around  time ,wating time average turn around time and  average wating time.</b></p>
